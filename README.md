Following along with the freecodecamp Dynamic programming course

## Source

For reference, the course in question can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBt53YbR9Kk&t=12153s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)
I definitely suggest you watch the videos as they will explain what's happening a lot better than someone who just looks at the code.

## Structure

- The course content is structured into two parts, part one discusses [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization), and part two discusses tabulation. I've split the files to reflect this, where file `1-Memoization` refers to part one, and `2-Tabulation` refers to part two.
- If you'd like a brief difference between tabulation and memoization, [Geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tabulation-vs-memoization/link) has a good brief write-up on it.

### Note

Please note, the course is created in nodejs, and as such all the code is written in JavaScript. Whereas my code is in python.
